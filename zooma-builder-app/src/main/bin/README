| Building ZOOMA |
+----------------+

You can use the scripts including in this package to generate, from scratch, a completely new, clean, ZOOMA instance.

Dependencies
============

These scripts require a Java installation and a working Virtuoso installation.  ZOOMA scripts have been tested and work
on Java version 1.7+ and Virtuoso version 6 and 7.

Configuration
=============

Before running these scripts, you must set the environmental variables $VIRTUOSO_HOME.  You can also set $ZOOMA_HOME if
you want to use a non-standard ZOOMA home directory.  Additionally, you can set $ZOOMA_OPTS to provide JVM options to
ZOOMA

$VIRTUOSO_HOME  - the location of the base directory of your Virtuoso installation
$ZOOMA_HOME     - the location of your ZOOMA home directory.  Defaults to $HOME/.zooma if not set.
$ZOOMA_OPTS     - optional additional Java options to supply to ZOOMA (e.g. -Xms1g -Xmx4g).

Before running ZOOMA, you need to copy the ZOOMA configuration module into your $ZOOMA_HOME directory

Execution
=========

You can configure details of ZOOMA building using zooma.properties in your $ZOOMA_HOME/config directory.  There is also
a considerable amount of advanced config it is possible to perform by editing the contents of the $ZOOMA_HOME/config
directory - subdirectories allow you to customize spring, virtuoso and logging configuration if you require.  If you
have a locally installed version of Virtuoso and you are building ZOOMA on the server you will use as a webserver,
however, no additional configuration should be required.

Data will be loaded into ZOOMA using your setup in the $ZOOMA_HOME/loaders directory.  In here you can deposit ZOOMA
loader plugins and edit the zooma-annotation-dao.xml configuration file to describe the CSV files and ontologies you
want to load.

Having set your required loaders, and edited the configuration if you require, you are ready to build the ZOOMA database.

To build the ZOOMA database, run the following scripts in order:

>: build-rdf.sh
>: build-virtuoso-index.sh

If you are building ZOOMA on a single machine, at this point start your local Virtuoso instance in order to build the
lucene indexes using

>: virtuoso-start.sh

If your Virtuoso index will run on a different server, at this point you can copy your Virtuoso indexes to the remote
server and start up that server using the scripts provided by Virtuoso.

Now, build lucene indexes

>: build-lucene-index.sh

Your ZOOMA data is ready to go.  Start up your web application and ZOOMA should be ready.

+---------------+
| ZOOMA Scripts |
+---------------+

A brief outline of each script included in this package is given below.

build-rdf.sh
----------------

Runs the ZOOMA loader to generate annotation RDF from the configured datasources.

build-rdf.lsf
-----------------

Runs the ZOOMA loader in an interactive shell on an LSF cluster.  This script runs in interactive mode, meaning that it
appears to run in the foreground but does not use resources on the local machine

build-rdf-submit.lsf
------------------------

Runs the ZOOMA loader by submitting a job for execution on an LSF cluster.  Because this executes the submit command, it
runs in the background: you don't have to wait for results.  Use this if you are running the RDF generation by hand
and you will be emailed the results.

build-virtuoso-index.sh
--------------------

A script that consumes and RDF directory and an output directory and generates a Virtuoso 'data index' from the given
RDF files.

build-lucene-index.sh
---------------------

A script that queries a sparql endpoint for raw annotation data and generates a Lucene index in the format expected by
the ZOOMA web application.
